A simple bot that takes an image from your computer and posts the image to Twitter along with some text.

There are various ways you can change the code around to make it do different things such as only tweet a photo or just text.

if you would like to use this bot there are a few things you must do first such as setting up a bot on Twitter, getting the consumer keys, and access tokens. You can easily find tutorials on youtube and other websites for free. 

if you already have all that set up all you would need to do is fill in the keys, tokens, and the name of your sheet on google sheets, set the folder path, and download the dependencies found in the requirements.txt file.
